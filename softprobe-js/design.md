# Softprobe Design (Main)

This is the primary entry point for Softprobe design.

Use this file for:
- system goals and boundaries
- end-to-end runtime flow
- links to focused design specifications

Use focused specs for implementation details:
- [Multi-repo and package layout](./design-multi-repo-layout.md)
- [Proxy-first capture and injection design](./design-proxy-first.md)
- [Context model](./design-context.md)
- [Cassette model (NDJSON)](./design-cassette.md)
- [Matcher model](./design-matcher.md)

## 1) Scope

Softprobe provides record/replay for backend dependency calls and inbound responses.

Core capabilities:
- context-scoped execution via OpenTelemetry context
- capture to cassette (NDJSON)
- replay from cassette with deterministic matching
- strict replay mode for CI isolation

Out of scope:
- broad framework abstraction beyond wrappers/interceptors
- perfect fidelity for all protocols and workloads

---

## 2) Architectural Units

1. `Context`: holds request/test scoped Softprobe state (`mode`, `traceId`, cassette handle, matcher).
2. `Cassette`: reads/writes trace records through a stable interface (`loadTrace()`, `saveRecord(record)`, optional `flush()`).
3. `Matcher`: resolves outbound calls to recorded payloads.
4. `Wrappers/Interceptors`: protocol integrations (HTTP/Postgres/Redis).

Detailed specs are in:
- [design-multi-repo-layout.md](./design-multi-repo-layout.md)
- [design-proxy-first.md](./design-proxy-first.md)
- [design-context.md](./design-context.md)
- [design-cassette.md](./design-cassette.md)
- [design-matcher.md](./design-matcher.md)

### 2.1 Instrumentation Package Strategy (OTel-style)

To scale to OTel-level ecosystem coverage, Softprobe uses package-specific instrumentations.

- `src/core/*`: framework-agnostic runtime contracts and shared execution context.
- `src/instrumentations/common/*`: protocol/domain helpers shared by multiple packages.
- `src/instrumentations/<package>/*`: package-specific patch/hook/wrapper logic.

Dependency direction is strict:
- allowed: `core -> (none)`, `instrumentations/<package> -> core + instrumentations/common`
- disallowed: `core -> instrumentations/<package>`, `instrumentations/<a> -> instrumentations/<b>`

Version support policy:
- each instrumentation declares and tests an explicit compatibility range
- behavior differences across major versions are handled in package-local branches/adapters
- no cross-package coupling for version-specific behavior

---

## 3) Runtime Flow

### 3.1 Capture

1. Entry middleware/hook builds run options and calls `SoftprobeContext.run(options, fn)`.
2. Application and child spans run with active softprobe context.
3. Capture hooks write inbound/outbound records through the active cassette.
4. NDJSON is written directly by the cassette implementation (no in-process buffer; optional flush for future optimization).

### 3.2 Replay

1. Entry middleware/hook builds replay run options and calls `SoftprobeContext.run(options, fn)`.
2. `run()` loads trace records from cassette once per run and seeds matcher state.
3. Wrappers/interceptors call matcher:
   - `MOCK`: return recorded payload
   - `PASSTHROUGH`: call original
   - `CONTINUE`: wrapper strict/dev policy

---

## 4) Integration Rules

- `softprobe/init` must run before OTel auto-instrumentation wraps dependency modules.
- Softprobe stores data under a dedicated OTel context key.
- Header coordination may override per-request runtime with:
  - `x-softprobe-mode`
  - `x-softprobe-trace-id`
- Cassette layout is one file per trace: `{cassetteDirectory}/{traceId}.ndjson`.

### 4.1 One-line init

Init loads config from `SOFTPROBE_CONFIG_PATH` or default `./.softprobe/config.yml`, seeds global defaults (`mode`, `cassetteDirectory`, strict flags), then patches pg, redis, undici, and the HTTP interceptor before OTel runs.

The app loads `softprobe/init` once (e.g. first in instrumentation or `node -r softprobe/init`). When OTel later runs `sdk.start()`, it gets cached modules and wraps on top of our layer. No post-`sdk.start()` calls are required.

### 4.2 Express-first rollout

Express is the first framework target for multi-version support hardening:
- injection must occur for both Express 4 and Express 5 route registration flows
- inbound capture must use request-scoped snapshot data at response write time so capture does not depend on late `context.active()` continuity across async boundaries

### 4.3 Wrapper Metadata Rules

Softprobe wrappers must not expose shimmer/OTel-style `__wrapped` metadata.

- Wrapper metadata keys are Softprobe-owned:
  - `__softprobeWrapped`: wrapper marker id (idempotency key)
  - `__softprobeOriginalName`: original function name for diagnostics
- Wrapping is applied through a shared runtime utility so all instrumentations follow one behavior.
- Wrapper replacement preserves call semantics and attempts to preserve the original function name.
- Goal: prevent wrapper conflicts where external instrumentation checks `__wrapped` and strips or rewires Softprobe wrappers.
