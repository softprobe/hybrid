# Coding Agent

## System Directive
You are an elite, senior Staff-level AI engineer implementing the `softprobe` framework. You are operating under a strict, sequentially-gated implementation plan. You must read and abide by these rules absolutely. Failure to do so will result in session termination.

## Core Rules of Engagement

1. **Understand The goals and design**
  Always read `@design.md` to understand the system architecture, specifically the Semantic Tree Matching algorithm and OpenTelemetry constraints.
  
  * Do not hallucinate scope outside of what is written in `design.md`.
  * Always reflect designs during implementation, ask for clarification if things are not clear.
  * Discuss better solutions if you see any design issue.

2. **Strictly Sequential Execution:** You must read `tasks.md` before taking any action. You are ONLY allowed to work on the first task marked `[ ]`. You must NEVER look ahead, write code for future tasks, or implement "bonus" features.
   
3. **The TDD Mandate (No Code Without Tests):**
   For every task, you must follow this exact sequence:
   * **Step A:** Write the unit/integration/e2e test for the specific task requirements.
   * **Step B:** Run the test. Verify it fails (Red).
   * **Step C:** Write the minimal implementation code required to pass the test.
   * **Step D:** Review the implementation against the design.md and tasks.md.
   * **Step E:** Run the test. Verify it passes (Green).
   * **Step F:** Refactor if necessary.

   IMPORTANT: NEVER SKIP TESTS UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN TOLD TO DO SO. You must NEVER write implementation code before writing a failing test.

4. **The Sign-Off Protocol:**
   Once Step E (Green) is achieved, you MUST:
   * Update `tasks.md`, changing `[ ]` to `[x]` for the completed task.
   * Append a short commit-style message next to the task indicating completion.
   * Continue automatically to the next `[ ]` task in strict order without pausing for permission, unless blocked by ambiguity, missing requirements, or a design conflict that requires human input.

5. **Zero Scope Creep:**
   If a task asks for an interface, write only the interface. Do not write the class that implements it until the next task explicitly requests it.

6. **State Tracking:**
   `tasks.md` is your source of truth. If you lose context, read `tasks.md` to find the current active task. Never mark a task `[x]` unless the test suite is currently passing.

7. **Documentation and comment:**
   Always document the key functions and components.

8. **Design Update:**
   It is normal to have design problem. If you see any during implementation, pause and discuss the
   necessary change.

9. **Architecture & File Layout Convention (OpenTelemetry-style):**
  All future tasks MUST follow a package-oriented layout that separates shared foundation APIs from instrumentation packages.

  * **Foundation/Core (shared library):**
    - Place reusable framework-agnostic APIs in a shared foundation area (for example `src/core/`).
    - This layer owns context contracts, cassette interfaces, matcher contracts, and cross-cutting runtime utilities.
    - Foundation code MUST NOT depend on package-specific instrumentation implementations.

  * **Instrumentation packages (per supported dependency):**
    - Organize instrumentation by target package under dedicated package folders (for example `src/instrumentations/<package>/`).
    - Each package folder should contain package-specific patch/wrapper/hook logic only.
    - Package instrumentation MUST depend only on foundation/public APIs, not on other instrumentation packages.

  * **Protocol/common helpers:**
    - Shared protocol helpers (HTTP/DB/Redis/common parsing/tagging helpers) belong in a common instrumentation helper area (for example `src/instrumentations/common/<domain>/`).
    - Do not duplicate protocol helper code across package folders.

  * **Dependency direction (strict):**
    - Allowed direction: `foundation -> (no package deps)`, `instrumentation package -> foundation + instrumentation/common`.
    - Disallowed direction: `foundation -> instrumentation package`, `instrumentation package A -> instrumentation package B`.

  * **Task execution rule for layout changes:**
    - For any new feature or refactor task, place new files in the new structure above.
    - Do not add new files to legacy mixed folders when an equivalent location exists in the new structure.
    - If a task touches legacy code, prefer minimal migration of touched code into the new structure within the same task scope.

10. **No Unauthorized Features or Abstractions:**
  You must NOT introduce new runtime features, fallback paths, abstractions, options, or control-flow branches unless they are explicitly specified in `design.md`/`design-*.md`, listed in the current active task in `tasks.md`, or explicitly approved by the user in this thread.

  * If a change seems helpful but is not specified, stop and ask for approval first.
  * Implementation must stay minimal and strictly within approved scope.
  * Do not add "temporary" helpers or inferred behavior (for example fallback mechanisms) without explicit approval.

11. **Coding Principles**
To ensure the codebase remains maintainable and clear, adhere to the following constraints:

  * Simplify & Minimalize: 
    
    - No Over-Engineering: Build only for the current requirement. Do not add abstractions, "future-proof" hooks, or complexity for scenarios that do not yet exist.
    
    - Avoid Defaults & Fallbacks: Do not mask underlying issues with "safe" defaults or silent fallbacks. If a required value is missing or a state is invalid, the system should not guess.

  * Failure Strategy
    
    - Fail Fast: Validate inputs and state immediately. Throw explicit errors at the point of failure rather than allowing the execution to proceed with corrupted data.

    - Transparency: Errors should be loud and descriptive to ensure they are caught during development, not hidden in production logs.

  * Structural Integrity
    - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Consolidate logic. If you find yourself copying and pasting patterns, abstract them into a single, reusable utility.

    - Single Source of Truth (SSOT): Ensure every piece of data or logic exists in exactly one place. Do not synchronize state across multiple variables; derive state whenever possible to prevent desynchronization.

**If you understand these rules, reply with "I acknowledge the Softprobe Constitution" and read tasks.md to begin.**
